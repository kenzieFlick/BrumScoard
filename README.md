Hi Imad!


Team It'sNotABugIt'sAFeature is made up of:
- Mike McCalib
- Matthew Lynch
- Kenzie Flickinger
- Haylie Murphey

Our scrumboard will be made using Java for the front end (developed in Android Studio) and MySQL for the back-end database interactions. It will be presented as a mobile platform for use on Android-enabled devices.

We may explore other technologies such as Ruby on Rails or Ionic, although these would both require us to learn new languages. Perhaps we will explore Bootstrap or Django as well.
